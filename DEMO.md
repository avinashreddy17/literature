# 🎮 Literature Game UI Demo (2024 Update)

## New UI Features
- All players are visible around a professional oval table
- Your hand is grouped by suit (♥ ♦ ♣ ♠) in a horizontal row at the bottom
- Turn indicator is at the top center
- Your name and team are shown above your hand
- Score and claimed sets are always visible at the top right
- Opponent hands show only 1-2 cards for clarity

## What We've Built So Far

We now have a **complete ask-card system** for the Literature game! Here's how it works:

### 🎯 **Core Functions Implemented:**
1. **`createDeck()`** - Creates 48-card Literature deck (no 8s)
2. **`shuffleDeck()`** - Randomizes deck using Fisher-Yates algorithm
3. **`initializeGame()`** - Sets up game state with proper teams and card dealing
4. **`validateMove()`** - Checks if moves (asks & claims) are legal
5. **`applyMove()`** - Executes valid moves and updates game state
6. **`checkClaim()`** - Complete half-suit claiming system with all Literature rules
7. **`isGameOver()`** - Detects when all 8 half-suits are claimed/cancelled
8. **`getGameResults()`** - Calculates final scores and determines winner
9. **`endGame()`** - Finalizes game state and sets phase to 'finished'
10. **`processClaimWithGameEnd()`** - Auto-ends game on final claim

### 🎲 **Example Game Flow:**

```typescript
// 1. Create and start a game with 6 players
const players = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve', 'Frank'];
let gameState = initializeGame(players);
gameState.phase = 'playing'; // Start the game

// 2. Alice wants to ask Bob for the 3 of Hearts
const move = {
  type: 'ask',
  fromPlayerId: 'alice',
  toPlayerId: 'bob',
  card: { suit: 'hearts', rank: '3' }
};

// 3. Validate the move first
if (validateMove(gameState, move)) {
  // 4. Apply the move if valid
  gameState = applyMove(gameState, move);
  
  if (gameState.lastMove.successful) {
    console.log('✅ Alice got the 3 of Hearts from Bob!');
    console.log('🎯 Alice keeps the turn and can ask again');
  } else {
    console.log('❌ Bob didn\'t have the 3 of Hearts');
    console.log('🔄 Turn passes to Bob');
  }
} else {
  console.log('🚫 Invalid move - check the rules!');
}
```

### 🔄 **Complete Ask-Card Workflow:**

```
Player wants to ask for card
         ↓
validateMove() checks 7 rules:
  ✓ Game in playing phase?
  ✓ Player's turn?
  ✓ Asking opponent (not teammate)?
  ✓ Target has cards?
  ✓ Don't already have the card?
  ✓ Have card in same half-suit?
  ✓ Asking in correct half (high/low)?
         ↓
If valid → applyMove() executes:
  • Search target's hand for card
  • If found: Transfer card, keep turn
  • If not found: No transfer, pass turn
  • Record move in game history
         ↓
Game state updated immutably
```

### 🎪 **Literature Rules Enforced:**

**Half-Suit System:**
- **Low Cards**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- **High Cards**: 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
- Can only ask for cards in same half-suit you possess

**Turn Logic:**
- **Successful ask**: Keep asking (build momentum!)
- **Failed ask**: Turn passes to target player

**Team Restrictions:**
- Can only ask opponents, never teammates
- Teams alternate: Alice(0), Bob(1), Charlie(0), Diana(1)...

### 🏆 **Complete Claiming System:**

```typescript
// Example: Alice claims low hearts for her team
const claim = {
  type: 'claim',
  playerId: 'alice',
  suit: 'hearts',
  isHigh: false,
  cardLocations: [
    { playerId: 'alice', cards: [{ suit: 'hearts', rank: '2' }] },
    { playerId: 'charlie', cards: [{ suit: 'hearts', rank: '3' }, ...] }
  ]
};

const claimResult = checkClaim(gameState, claim);
if (claimResult.success) {
  console.log(`🏆 Team ${claimResult.winningTeam} wins low hearts!`);
} else if (claimResult.winningTeam !== null) {
  console.log(`🔄 Opposing team gets the half-suit!`);
} else {
  console.log(`❌ Claim failed: ${claimResult.message}`);
}
```

**Three Claiming Outcomes:**
- ✅ **Perfect claim**: Team gets the half-suit
- ❌ **Wrong locations**: Half-suit cancelled (nobody wins)
- 🔄 **Opponent interference**: Opposing team gets the half-suit

### 🏁 **Complete Game Ending System:**

```typescript
// Check if game is over after each claim
if (isGameOver(gameState)) {
  const results = getGameResults(gameState);
  const finalState = endGame(gameState);
  
  console.log(`🎉 Game Over!`);
  console.log(`Team 0: ${results.team0Score} half-suits`);
  console.log(`Team 1: ${results.team1Score} half-suits`);
  console.log(`Cancelled: ${results.cancelledSets} half-suits`);
  
  if (results.winner !== null) {
    console.log(`🏆 ${results.message}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`🤝 ${results.message}`);
  }
}

// Or use the convenience function for automatic ending
const claimResult = processClaimWithGameEnd(gameState, claim);
if (claimResult.gameEnded) {
  console.log(`🎉 Game ended: ${claimResult.gameResults.message}`);
}
```

**Game Ending Rules:**
- **End condition**: All 8 half-suits must be claimed or cancelled
- **Score calculation**: Only successful claims count (cancelled sets don't)
- **Winner determination**: Team with most half-suits wins
- **Tie handling**: Games can end in ties (e.g., 4-4 or 3-3 with 2 cancelled)

### 📊 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **10 phases completed** out of 20+ total
- ✅ **10 core functions** + 12+ helpers implemented  
- ✅ **1400+ lines** of game logic and tests
- ✅ **100% test coverage** of all functions
- 🎉 **PHASE 1: GAME LOGIC 100% COMPLETE!**

### 🚀 **What Players Can Now Do** (via game engine):
✅ **Create and join games** (6 or 8 players)  
✅ **Ask opponents for specific cards**  
✅ **Chain successful asks for momentum**  
✅ **Claim complete half-suits for points**  
✅ **Handle all three claiming scenarios** (success/wrong locations/opponent interference)  
✅ **Track game progress and scores**  
✅ **Automatically end games** when all half-suits are claimed
✅ **Calculate final results** with winner determination
✅ **Handle ties and cancelled sets** properly

**The Literature game engine foundation is complete!** Ready for Phase 2: Backend Development! 🎉
